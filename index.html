<p>Cindy Huang, is a beginner digital artist exploring the functions of procreate. She aims to explore different forms of media and art that works best. During her exploration of multiple medias, the use of apps like capcut and procreate sparked her interest in video editting and animation. As a result, she hopes to learn more about being a professional background artist in the animation field. </p>
