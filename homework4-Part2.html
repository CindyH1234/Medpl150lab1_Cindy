   <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>For this photomontage, I wanted to portray turtle's struggle in the sea with plastic on the beach. First, I compiled images from google and imported them on to photoshop. I then used the select subject tool to make a mask and hide the background of the images. I used the multiply layer for thr plastic bag because it helped hide the white background and resized the plastic bag. I put the plastic bag on the turtle to make it look like it is entangled and in need of help.  </p>
