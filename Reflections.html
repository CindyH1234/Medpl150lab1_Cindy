<p> I mainly use photography to capture moments of the current events happening around me. This can range from moments I would like to keep in a 2d way so I can look back on the memories or information I need to have on me that I can look back on anytime. I use different apps or softwares to edit the memories I capture, often playing with filters which can greatly change how people see the reality I captured. For Example, if I had captured an orange sunset, I could use my camera filters to change the tone of the photo, making the sunset more saturated. This makes viewers see a different reality than what I had faced when I took the photo. In most of the photos I take, I like to adjust the saturation, highlights, contrast and shadows of my photos to make my photos look more visually appealing. The reason why I do this is because I wanted to make the image as visually appealing as possible to the reality I had experienced. 

       Through photography, I could use different types of moods to represent the world. The world is hard to capture with one theme and I would separate it by groups like scenery, culture, history or document photos of major global events. The use of color which can be obtained using different software or apps can help shape a viewer’s perception of the things we capture. Similarly to photos, illustrations are great ways to convey reality. Though it has its limitations of being 2d,  drawings, cartoons, collage compare and contrast fantasy and reality. It gives many viewers a clear distinction between what they can perceive as reality. Additionally, illustrations create another version of reality, copying many aspects of the real world that draws our attention to many underlying issues or moments we tend to overlook. 

    With only photos, it can capture a moment of reality. However it isn’t able to interpret the meaning or reality the photographer wanted to capture. That is where text comes in and gives is more context about what is being portrayed. This includes posters or thumbnails of videos that are seen online. The photos are there to catch your eye, to gain sympathy or emotions it was meant to portray or give it a perception that it wants to give about a certain moment that was captured. With the words, it can help motivate and encourage other people, giving each other further understanding of what the pictures wish for it to portray. 

A combination of images is like a collage or a mood board. It can help you put together images of similar ideas. I could use this to brainstorm ideas and communicate to another person, sharing a vision of reality the other wishes to see. What is fascinating is that it gives you an idea how the final product is going to look without actually showing the product. It’s the imagination that comes along with it that makes it enjoyable to how we picture a reality that we want to see.
