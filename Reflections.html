<p> I mainly use photography to capture moments of the current events happening around me. This can range from moments I would like to keep in a 2d way so I can look back on the memories or information I need to have on me that I can look back on anytime. I use different apps or softwares to edit the memories I capture, often playing with filters which can greatly change how people see the reality I captured. For Example, if I had captured an orange sunset, I could use my camera filters to change the tone of the photo, making the sunset more saturated. This makes viewers see a different reality than what I had faced when I took the photo. In most of the photos I take, I like to adjust the saturation, highlights, contrast and shadows of my photos to make my photos look more visually appealing. The reason why I do this is because I wanted to make the image as visually appealing as possible to the reality I had experienced. 

       Through photography, I could use different types of moods to represent the world. The world is hard to capture with one theme and I would separate it by groups like scenery, culture, history or document photos of major global events. The use of color which can be obtained using different software or apps can help shape a viewer’s perception of the things we capture. Similarly to photos, illustrations are great ways to convey reality. Though it has its limitations of being 2d,  drawings, cartoons, collage compare and contrast fantasy and reality. It gives many viewers a clear distinction between what they can perceive as reality. Additionally, illustrations create another version of reality, copying many aspects of the real world that draws our attention to many underlying issues or moments we tend to overlook. 

    With only photos, it can capture a moment of reality. However it isn’t able to interpret the meaning or reality the photographer wanted to capture. That is where text comes in and gives is more context about what is being portrayed. This includes posters or thumbnails of videos that are seen online. The photos are there to catch your eye, to gain sympathy or emotions it was meant to portray or give it a perception that it wants to give about a certain moment that was captured. With the words, it can help motivate and encourage other people, giving each other further understanding of what the pictures wish for it to portray. 

A combination of images is like a collage or a mood board. It can help you put together images of similar ideas. I could use this to brainstorm ideas and communicate to another person, sharing a vision of reality the other wishes to see. What is fascinating is that it gives you an idea how the final product is going to look without actually showing the product. It’s the imagination that comes along with it that makes it enjoyable to how we picture a reality that we want to see.

     <h3 style= color:blue; align:center;>"With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster</h3>
  
<p> I agree with the part where it mentions that the “result is not just a blurring of reality, but a distortion of it”, because like many medias it can be used to spread misinformation. Ai, if used in a specific way, is able to make videos and audio sound realistic enough for people to believe in its content. It blurs the line between reality and what is not real. It’s disappointing to have to see how many people have to fact check certain news they hear from others just to see if something is real or not. This impacts a lot of people ranging from age groups to even professions. As a digital artist, it is heartbreaking to see art being made with minimal human input. These arts are then stolen to make videos that continue to spread disinformation and continue to deplete the trust people can get through the news. Additionally, as mentioned in the article, “ Most of the time, AI slop is just content farming chaos. Exaggerated or sensationalised online material boosts engagement, giving creators the chance to make money based on shares, comments, and so on”. It’s frustrating to see that many ai content creators get more engagement on posts using ai and earn more than those who do in fact, put a lot of time into their work. It completely messes up the algorithm and makes people who have actual effort in their work have lower engagement and thus earn less money. 

It is also disturbing how deeply serious content is being posted as entertainment. I personally feel like things like this shouldn't be portrayed as entertainment because it confuses people on whether they should take things seriously or not. This is dangerous for people who don’t often read the news or are up to date on technology. People in older generations are introduced to ai media and can be very easily mislead dure to lack of experience with technology. They chose to believe what they are able to see. To be able to explain that it’s not true despite having “seen the truth” is difficult. As human beings we all believe what we see, it is what we all grew up to develop. I believe AI disrupts that and makes us unable to differentiate which part we are seeing is real. As mentioned earlier, it’s blurring reality and it’s affecting how reliable something like news can be. I think it’s dangerous because it spreads misinformation and people that are affected by it can be in danger. Entertainment is there to grab attention to strong feelings like joy and humor. However, Ai tends to exaggerate, leading to disrespect towards families affected and can cause people’s ability to think irrationally. Especially with Ai Videos, certain news can be generated to look a certain way just to drive public opinion. Ai does not have emotions and will make content that can easily offend people. Ai that is able to distort reality with such realistic videos with no human emotions is dangerous.
