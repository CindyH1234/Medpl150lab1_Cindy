     <h2 style="color:blue; align:center;">“In Plato’s Cave” chapter 1 from On Photography by Susan Sontag</h2>

<p> I mainly use photography to capture moments of the current events happening around me. This can range from moments I would like to keep in a 2d way so I can look back on the memories or information I need to have on me that I can look back on anytime. I use different apps or softwares to edit the memories I capture, often playing with filters which can greatly change how people see the reality I captured. For Example, if I had captured an orange sunset, I could use my camera filters to change the tone of the photo, making the sunset more saturated. This makes viewers see a different reality than what I had faced when I took the photo. In most of the photos I take, I like to adjust the saturation, highlights, contrast and shadows of my photos to make my photos look more visually appealing. The reason why I do this is because I wanted to make the image as visually appealing as possible to the reality I had experienced. 

       Through photography, I could use different types of moods to represent the world. The world is hard to capture with one theme and I would separate it by groups like scenery, culture, history or document photos of major global events. The use of color which can be obtained using different software or apps can help shape a viewer’s perception of the things we capture. Similarly to photos, illustrations are great ways to convey reality. Though it has its limitations of being 2d,  drawings, cartoons, collage compare and contrast fantasy and reality. It gives many viewers a clear distinction between what they can perceive as reality. Additionally, illustrations create another version of reality, copying many aspects of the real world that draws our attention to many underlying issues or moments we tend to overlook. 

    With only photos, it can capture a moment of reality. However it isn’t able to interpret the meaning or reality the photographer wanted to capture. That is where text comes in and gives is more context about what is being portrayed. This includes posters or thumbnails of videos that are seen online. The photos are there to catch your eye, to gain sympathy or emotions it was meant to portray or give it a perception that it wants to give about a certain moment that was captured. With the words, it can help motivate and encourage other people, giving each other further understanding of what the pictures wish for it to portray. 

A combination of images is like a collage or a mood board. It can help you put together images of similar ideas. I could use this to brainstorm ideas and communicate to another person, sharing a vision of reality the other wishes to see. What is fascinating is that it gives you an idea how the final product is going to look without actually showing the product. It’s the imagination that comes along with it that makes it enjoyable to how we picture a reality that we want to see.

     <h3 style= color:blue; align:center;>With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster</h3>
  
<p> I agree with the part where it mentions that the “result is not just a blurring of reality, but a distortion of it”, because like many medias it can be used to spread misinformation. Ai, if used in a specific way, is able to make videos and audio sound realistic enough for people to believe in its content. It blurs the line between reality and what is not real. It’s disappointing to have to see how many people have to fact check certain news they hear from others just to see if something is real or not. This impacts a lot of people ranging from age groups to even professions. As a digital artist, it is heartbreaking to see art being made with minimal human input. These arts are then stolen to make videos that continue to spread disinformation and continue to deplete the trust people can get through the news. Additionally, as mentioned in the article, “ Most of the time, AI slop is just content farming chaos. Exaggerated or sensationalised online material boosts engagement, giving creators the chance to make money based on shares, comments, and so on”. It’s frustrating to see that many ai content creators get more engagement on posts using ai and earn more than those who do in fact, put a lot of time into their work. It completely messes up the algorithm and makes people who have actual effort in their work have lower engagement and thus earn less money. 

It is also disturbing how deeply serious content is being posted as entertainment. I personally feel like things like this shouldn't be portrayed as entertainment because it confuses people on whether they should take things seriously or not. This is dangerous for people who don’t often read the news or are up to date on technology. People in older generations are introduced to ai media and can be very easily mislead dure to lack of experience with technology. They chose to believe what they are able to see. To be able to explain that it’s not true despite having “seen the truth” is difficult. As human beings we all believe what we see, it is what we all grew up to develop. I believe AI disrupts that and makes us unable to differentiate which part we are seeing is real. As mentioned earlier, it’s blurring reality and it’s affecting how reliable something like news can be. I think it’s dangerous because it spreads misinformation and people that are affected by it can be in danger. Entertainment is there to grab attention to strong feelings like joy and humor. However, Ai tends to exaggerate, leading to disrespect towards families affected and can cause people’s ability to think irrationally. Especially with Ai Videos, certain news can be generated to look a certain way just to drive public opinion. Ai does not have emotions and will make content that can easily offend people. Ai that is able to distort reality with such realistic videos with no human emotions is dangerous.

 <h4 style= color:blue; align:center;> Motherhood Stories</h4>
  
<p>I chose the story called My Stolen Future which is about an African girl who was pregnant with a child and her struggles throughout her life. The story uses a comic format with dialogue and speech bubbles to depict what the African girl is going through. I think illustration was used because it gave the story a more visual sense that can help viewers feel like they are experiencing the narrator’s story in a more immersive way. It helps to gain sympathy or empathy from the audience and allows us to further understand or see the expressions of the characters in the story. The use of text in the form of a black box was used for the narration of the story and the speech bubbles that were made to appear after a certain amount of time made it easy for viewers to follow. I think it is also interesting how they put photos in the illustrations too because it can help to give different interpretations. From what I think, it makes me believe that the illustrations are like moments of the past that the narrator has difficulty processing or accepting that ruined her life. However the photos help her ground herself in that reality or it could also serve as a way to remind readers that the story is true. It is a nice blend of reality and fiction.The video that appears later where a counselor talks about the difficulties of young women helps to tie together the sympathy of the audience and it is like a call to action or to spread awareness. A video is being shown because it allows the audience to connect with a real person which further evokes a feeling of empathy.The illustrations vary from the photographs because it shows more action and expressions that photographs cannot completely capture. Photographs are sometimes not able to capture the full story of something in a way illustrations can. There are some things that may be difficult to capture with photos that illustration can. I think with the text it allows the viewer to understand the story without the misinterpretation. This may not be as effective if it was just text or photography because these can be either misinterpreted, or does not completely reflect the story of the person.

<h5 style= color:blue; align:center;>The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It, by W. J. Hennigan, NY Times</h5>
<p>In the New York Times article “The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It “, it starts out with a few short sentences, with a red background. I think this is such a strong way to start because the red stands out which gives the viewer a feeling that the content on the screen is important. The size of the text is big enough to be read and the action of sliding down lets the viewer process the information that is displayed on the screen. It is then transitioned to a regular New York Times website format, where the reader can focus on the context of what is being said. 

It is sad to know that the world is in a state in which we all fear the possibility of a nuclear attack. This frightening possibility is clearly shown by the darker red background that follows afterwards with a powerful phrase, “IMAGINE A NUCLEAR WEAPON IS LAUNCHED”. The sentence is written in all caps that provides a sense of urgency to be addressed and a red background is usually used for showing how dangerous a situation can be. The darker the red, the more dangerous a situation can be. This can help to spread realization and awareness to the issue because many people have forgotten the consequences of a threat like this. Especially in the world today, there are talks about nuclear attacks but they often don’t really happen. Media today often uses ai videos to talk show the horrors in what would happen if it were true. However, the media isn’t really taken seriously because of the Mutual Assured Destruction between many countries. It is that belief that allows people to believe a nuclear attack like this wouldn’t happen because it would cause world destruction from its nuclear power.

 Additionally, The article has illustrations to help visualize in the background how these nuclear bombs work, and  how dangerous or destructive it could be. The illustrations make it feel as if we were experiencing something like this in person, in a way we can better visualize the horrors of a nuclear bomb. Through many illustrations and text that appear, they depict the process of destruction and the lives that are lost, giving us the feeling of traveling through time in a way to experience this. It is almost like a simulation of what would happen. It is also in a way disturbingly detailed, that can also give the viewer a sense of unease. 

After these illustrations are over, it is followed by another long part of the text from a New York Times article. Because of the visualizations, many viewers would already be heavily concerned about the issue and it would be effective. The global map displaying how many nuclear weapons are in different countries give me just as much anxiety because we have already seen what one nuclear bomb can do in that illustration. It is at this point that we would realize just how much lives would be lost based on just one or a few people’s decisions.
