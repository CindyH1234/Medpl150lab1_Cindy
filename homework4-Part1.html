   <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>I wanted to use this photomontage to show our tendency to hide ourselves behind a mask. The girl with the mask in the mirror is our persona, the one who hides their true self and acts like someone they aren't. I got these photos mainly from the images through the search tool on Photoshop. The mask and the girl standing with her back towards the viewer are images I found on Google. After importing my images, I used the background removal tool, which made a mask of the images and removed the background from view. I proceeded to go to the layer with the girl and the mirror and changed the blending mode to screen because it made her more transparent. I wanted to show that only we can see the persona we are holding up and that it is a secret to others. Lastly, I adjusted the background's brightness and contrast, specifically the bathroom mirror, to make the setting look dark and gloomy despite the smile on the mirror girl's face..   </p>
